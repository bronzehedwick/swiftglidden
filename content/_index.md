In March of 2020, I contracted SARS-CoV-2 and tested positive for COVID-19 after developing symptoms.

While recovering, I wrote and produced a 2 song album about the ordeal. You can find those songs - my first original release as a solo artist - <a href="https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/grantswift/fear-and-love-in-the-time-of-corona" target="_blank">HERE!</a>

I also produced a music video, which you can watch below!
