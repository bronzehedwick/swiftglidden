<hr>

In March of 2020, I contracted SARS-CoV-2 and tested positive for COVID-19 after developing symptoms.

While recovering, I wrote and produced a 2 song album about the ordeal. You can find those songs <a href="https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/grantswift/fear-and-love-in-the-time-of-corona" target="_blank">here.</a>

I also produced a music video, which you can watch below.

Check out my [Bio and Press Kit](/page/bio/) for more about me.

You can hire me for private or public events [HERE](/page/hire-grant/)
