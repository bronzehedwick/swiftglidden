Grant Swift is a New York City boy and the son of a preacher. Born in Manhattan, formed in the tri-state, and educated in the Bronx, he currently hails from Brooklyn. His original works "brilliantly recreate a modern mashup sound"<sup><strong><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></strong></sup> by deploying his eclectic training in Baroque and Classical music, as well as the R&B, Psychedelic Rock, Jazz, and Pop he played growing up. His award-winning performances as a singer, guitarist, and one-man band have earned him acclaim throughout the United States.<sup><strong><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></strong></sup> He is one half of the acoustic duo Mac/Glidden<sup><strong><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></strong></sup> and The Huffington Post called his previous musical project The Candy Apples<sup><strong><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></strong></sup> one of "5 Must-See Indie Summer Concerts in NYC" in 2014.<sup><strong><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></strong></sup>

While studying at Fordham University, Grant served as the Music Director of ICCA Semi-Finalists, The Fordham Ramblers, Fordham University’s original all-male acapella group. As he earned a full double major BA in Music Composition and Philosophy, Grant led the group to their first Quarterfinal placement, with his characteristically intricate vocal arrangements.

With longtime songwriting partner Andy McCarthy, Grant wrote, performed and engineered Mac/Glidden's debut psychedelic-folk-rock album, *Fall Into The Dark*, released in 2017. Their music video for the song “Mountains,”<sup><strong><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></strong></sup> &nbsp;directed and animated by Laurie Berenhaus, was an official selection at Sidewalk Film Festival, Indie Memphis Fest, and Leeds International Film Festival, among others.

Also in 2017, he had the great honor of being invited by the late, prodigious, two-time Emmy Award Winning Music Director for Saturday Night Live, Katreese Barnes<sup><strong><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></strong></sup> &nbsp;to perform in her home for her live stream concert series, *Welcome 2 My House*. Katreese wrote orchestral arrangements of Mac/Glidden songs for the concert, and provided a full backing band.<sup><strong><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8,</a> <a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></strong></sup> &nbsp;Katreese said, “Mac/Glidden are keepers of the classic Music flame. It was a pleasure to work with them.”

While gigging in March of 2020, Grant contracted SARS-CoV-2. He developed symptoms within 3 days of exposure and tested positive for COVID-19. During his 2.5 week in-home recovery, Grant wrote and recorded a 2-song album about his varying perspectives on the pandemic, "Fear and Love in the Time of Corona", and produced a music video in NYC Parks for the second song, "Love (In the Time of Corona)".<sup><strong><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10,</a> <a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></strong></sup> &nbsp;Grant is currently working on two upcoming albums of original psych-pop-rock and folk material to be released in 2021. A still officially "unreleased" first single is "I'm The Man."<sup><strong><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></strong></sup> &nbsp;He is also currently writing and recording the soundtrack for an upcoming iOS and Android video game.

Grant plays regularly in a variety of formats in both private and public venues throughout the United States. His clients have included Audi North America, The New York Yacht Club, Time Out New York, and Hudson Yards.
