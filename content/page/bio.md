NYC native Grant Swift Glidden is a composer, multi-instrumentalist, and the acclaimed vocalist and guitarist of the acoustic duo mac/glidden. 

While studying at Fordham University, Grant served as the Music Director of 2-time ICCA Semi-Finalists, The Fordham Ramblers, Fordham University’s original all-male acapella group. As he earned his BA in Music Composition, Grant led the group to their first Quarter Finals placement, with his characteristically intricate vocal arrangements.

With his longtime songwriting partner Andy McCarthy, Grant wrote, performed and engineered mac/glidden's debut psychedelic-folk-rock album, *Fall Into The Dark*, released in 2017, and currently in publishing contract negotiations for film and television licensing. Their music video for the song “Mountains,” directed and animated by Laurie Berenhaus, was featured at Sidewalk Film Festival and Indie Memphis Fest, among others. The Huffington Post called their previous musical duo project The Candy Apples, one of "5 Must-See Indie Summer Concerts in NYC" in 2014.

Grant plays regularly in mac/glidden in a wide variety of public and private venues throughout the Northeast, additionally earning a great reputation as a wedding band with their large cover song repertoire. He also performs as a soloist throughout the NYC area, and is working on an upcoming album of original psych-folk-rock material to be released in 2018.

Most recently he composed and recorded the scores for Abandoned House Productions' two upcoming premiere releases, [The Slightest Touch](https://vimeo.com/223501848) and [The Shadow Scarf](https://vimeo.com/221091888): short psychological thriller films about abuse, betrayal, and revenge in the modern age.
