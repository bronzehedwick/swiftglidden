NYC native Grant Swift Glidden is an acclaimed vocalist, guitarist, composer and producer. He is one half of the acoustic duo Mac/Glidden.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> &nbsp;His music is uncanny but warm, inspired by an eclectic mix of 60's pop and R&B, jazz standards, 90's alternative, and the choral, baroque and classical music he was trained in as a boy. Impose Magazine said it "brilliantly recreates a modern mashup sound,"<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> &nbsp;and The Huffington Post called his previous musical duo project The Candy Apples,<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> &nbsp;one of "5 Must-See Indie Summer Concerts in NYC" in 2014.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>

While studying at Fordham University, Grant served as the Music Director of ICCA Semi-Finalists, The Fordham Ramblers, Fordham University’s original all-male acapella group. As he earned a full double major BA in Music Composition and Philosophy, Grant led the group to their first Quarterfinal placement, with his characteristically intricate vocal arrangements.

With his longtime songwriting partner Andy McCarthy, Grant wrote, performed and engineered Mac/Glidden's debut psychedelic-folk-rock album, *Fall Into The Dark*, released in 2017. Their music video for the song “Mountains,”<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> &nbsp;directed and animated by Laurie Berenhaus, was an official selection at Sidewalk Film Festival, Indie Memphis Fest, and Leeds International Film Festival, among others. Also in 2017, they had the great honor of being invited by the late, prodigious, two-time Emmy Award Winning Music Director for Saturday Night Live, Katreese Barnes<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> &nbsp;to perform in her home for her live stream concert series, *Welcome 2 My House*. Katreese wrote original arrangements for several of their songs and provided a backing band and orchestra for the live stream performance.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7,</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> &nbsp;Katreese said, “Mac/Glidden are keepers of the classic Music flame. It was a pleasure to work with them.”

Grant is currently working on an upcoming album of original psych-pop-rock material to be released in 2020. The still officially "unreleased" first single is "I'm The Man"<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> &nbsp;as well as writing and recording the soundtrack for an upcoming video game for iOS and Android.

Grant plays regularly in a variety of formats in both private and public venues throughout the United States. He has earned a great reputation as a cover song performer and one-man band.<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10,</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11,</a></sup> &nbsp;His clients have included Audi North America, The New York Yacht Club, and Time Out New York.
