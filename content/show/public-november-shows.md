Two very cool shows to check out in November

- Friday, November 15th I'll be performing an intimate showcase of original compositions at the GAMBA gallery in Brooklyn with a great singer-songwriter and friend of mine, Age Of The Bear. Tickets are very limited (only 15 spots available) and are available through the arts platform Artery [HERE!](https://www.artery.is/showcases/grant-swift-and-age-of-the-bear "Grant Swift and Age Of The Bear") Half of the proceeds will go to help the operating costs of the GAMBA gallery. 7-9pm.

- Saturday, November 30th I'll be returning to TimeOut Market at the Empire Stores in Brooklyn Bridge Park for 2 sets of covers in their awesome indoor/outdoor rooftop space with plenty of great dining options and a full bar. 7-9pm.

Hope to see you here, there, or everywhere.
